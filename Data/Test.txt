The cubic function defined by
    y = (((((a * x) + b) * x) + c) * x) + d
was evaluated with coefficients
    a = 0.5
    b = -0.25
    c = 0.5
    d = 0.25
for 5 values of x
    x[0] = -1
    x[1] = -0.7
    x[2] = -0.3
    x[3] = 0.2
    x[4] = 1
to produce 5 values of y
    y[0] = -1
    y[1] = -0.394
    y[2] = 0.064
    y[3] = 0.344
    y[4] = 1

The spline function generated from 5 data points and defined by
    y = a0 * y0 + a1 * y1 + h * b0 * s0 + h * b1 * s1
was evaluated at its midpoints
    y = 0.5 * y0 + 0.5 * y1 + 0.125 * h * s0 - 0.125 * h * s1
    dy/dx = (-1.5 * y0 + 1.5 * y1 - 0.25 * h * s0 - 0.25 * h * s1) / h
    d2y/dx2 = (0.0 * y0 + 0.0 * y1 - 1.0 * h * s0 + 1.0 * h * s1) / (h * h)
