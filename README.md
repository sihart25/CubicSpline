# CubicSpline
The aim of this assessment was to produce a program to generate and display cubic splines. The program was tested by fitting a cubic spline to a cubic function, and comparing the results of the cubic spline with those of the cubic function. The programâ€™s user interface allows data points to be inserted, deleted and moved. Data points can be read from and written to text files, and several pre-defined curves are provided. Cubic splines of one, two or three functions can be displayed. Cubic splines of more than one function are displayed both independently, and as curves in a two or three dimensional coordinate system. Three dimensional curves can be rotated and projected.
